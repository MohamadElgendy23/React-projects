REACT PROJECTS 

1) Todo-List: 
>Simple app that lets the user enter items that needs to be completed (todo-items) and said items are shown in the todo-items list.
>User can also toggle a todo-item and delete a todo-item without messing with other items in the list. 
>The react project utilizes good architecture and everything is seperated in a clean and organized manner.
  >App.jsx only renders one component (as recommended) while every other component deals with its own task for the UI.

2) Quiz App:
>A quiz app that is visually appealing and offers users the ability to enter their name and select what topic of questions they want to be quizzed on. The topics are CS, Math, and Geography.
