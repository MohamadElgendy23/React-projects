React projects

Todo-List: 
>Simple app that lets the user enter items that needs to be completed (todo-items) and said items are shown in the todo-items list.
>User can also toggle a todo-item and delete a todo-item without messing with other items in the list. 
>The react project utilizes good architecture and everything is seperated in a clean and organized manner.
  >App.jsx only renders one component (as recommended) while every other component deals with its own task for the UI.
